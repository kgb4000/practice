                <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                  I'm Kester, the heart and soul behind Sea Moss Wellness.
                </p>
                <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                  From the very start, my dream was to create something truly
                  special â€“ a company that stands for more than just profit.
                </p>
                <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                  Every day, my team and I pour our values, integrity, and
                  unwavering dedication into everything we do, from sourcing our
                  sea moss, to our packaging.
                </p>
                <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                  At Sea Moss Wellness, it's not just about running a business;
                  it's about giving you the best products.
                </p>
                <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                  I'm personally involved in every part of the process because
                  putting my name on it means something.
                </p>
                <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                  After all, my family and I use sea moss every day, and I
                  wouldn't have it any other way.
                </p>
                <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                  Your trust means the world to me.
                </p>
                <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
